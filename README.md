# Discord Server Setup
This will show you the step-by-step process on how to setup StuffyBot on your discord server!

1. Invite StuffyBot to your discord server using https://thingyservers.xyz. Make sure to follow the instructions there!
2. Once, StuffyBot is on your server, we need to set your music channel. 
First, at your discord window/app, go to your "User Settings" by clicking the gear icon near to your discord tag (bottom-left corner).
